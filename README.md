# Python Excel Automation Script

This project demonstrates a simple but powerful Python script for automating repetitive Excel tasks — perfect for small businesses, data entry, or anyone who wants to save time.

## 📌 What It Does
- Reads data from an existing Excel file (`input.xlsx`).
- Filters rows based on a condition (e.g., keep rows where `Amount` > 1000).
- Exports the filtered data to a new Excel file (`output.xlsx`).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **pandas**
- **openpyxl** (for Excel file support)

## 🚀 How to Use
1. **Clone this repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Deepansri94/python-excel-automation.git
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas openpyxl
   ```
3. **Add your Excel file**  
   - Place your `input.xlsx` in the same folder as the script.

4. **Run the script**  
   ```bash
   python filter_excel.py
   ```

5. **Check the output**  
   - A new file `output.xlsx` will be created with filtered rows.

## ✔️ How You Can Use This

- Automating Excel reports.
- Cleaning and transforming data.
- Scheduling recurring data tasks.
